# Communication System Design 
## Lab 7 Using USRP and LTE to transmitting an Image

### Assignments

1. Image transmission simulation based on LTE.
2. Recover the image with the recorded data 'rxWaveform1.mat'. This is a data from the course packet.
3. Image transmission by using USRP.

### Progress

#### Date:5-16
After reading code files, we know that this lab is quiet similar to the last lab content. And the file 'LTESim.m' has been completed and tested. This file also contain some *sdru* codes which can be used for USRP. 

Otherwise, we tried to rewrite for further understaend. And we had built two files call 'sdruLTETX.m' and 'sdruLTERx.m' for USRP. However, they have not been tested yet.
